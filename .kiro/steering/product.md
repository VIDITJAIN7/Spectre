# Product Vision: The "Agentic Full-Stack" Skeleton

## Overview

This is a generative, full-stack application skeleton designed for rapid MVP prototyping and startup idea validation.

## Target Users

- Solo founders testing new product concepts
- Developer teams building internal tools quickly
- Technical entrepreneurs validating market fit through working prototypes

## Value Proposition

Generate production-grade, well-architected full-stack applications from a single high-level prompt. Each generated app includes:

- Clean separation of concerns (frontend, backend, data)
- Auto-generated documentation via intelligent agent hooks
- Test stubs for all components and services
- Local-first development with zero external dependencies
- Flexible architecture adaptable to diverse use cases

## Design Principles

- **Lean**: Minimal boilerplate, maximum functionality
- **Clear**: Obvious project structure and code organization
- **Flexible**: Generate distinct application types from the same template
- **Intelligent**: Agent hooks automate documentation and testing
- **Local**: Complete development environment without external services

## Success Criteria

The skeleton succeeds when it can generate two completely different applications (e.g., productivity tool vs. data visualization) from the same foundational structure.
